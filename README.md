MapTileProvider
===============

Easily acquire satellite imagery from within a Godot scene. MapTileProvider
requests satellite and/or cartographic imagery from tile servers via HTTP(S).
Tiles may optionally be cached by MapTileProvider in the user:// directory.

There are two *trash* examples in `addons/map_tile_provider/examples` that show
how to interact with the MapTileLoader class to load tiles. The examples
**DO NOT** show best practice for displaying the map tiles.
